# python-local-alignment

Find the highest-scoring local alignment between two strings.

Given two amino acid strings, the max score of a local alignment of the strings is returned, followed by this max scoring local alignment. The PAM250 scoring matrix and indel penalty Ïƒ = 5 were used. If multiple local alignments achieving the maximum score exist, any such alignment is returned.
